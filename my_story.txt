My Story
By: Aaron and the Students of 98-174 F17

Chapter 1
---------
Once upon a time, a squirrel named Nibbles lived alone in a vast forest.
Every day, Nibbles would leave the safety of his home in the big oak tree
to search for acorns to save up for the long, cold winter.
One brisk October day, Nibbles was returning home with his cheeks full of
acorns. As he peeped into the entrance to his burrow, he gasped in surprise
at what he saw.

"Mmmmmf frmmmfff rffffulmf!?" he shouted. The cheeks full of acorns weren't helping at all. "Are 
you kidding me right now!?" he shouted, more successfully, after having spit the acorns out.

"Who do I know who would give me a surprise pennyfarthing?" Nibbles thought. It was so generous, 
so unexpectedâ€¦it could only have been the Duke of Bigtree.

"Uh oh. He wants something from me," he thought.

He was right.
